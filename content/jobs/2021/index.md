- built the project <span style="color: #64ffda">  [AR sandbox](/projects)</span> at my high school and showcased it at a few events.
- learned more about LINUX especially KALI and most of it's tools which led me into learning more about defensive security and white hat hacking.
- deployed a few servers at home and started practicing attacks inside containers using KASM.
